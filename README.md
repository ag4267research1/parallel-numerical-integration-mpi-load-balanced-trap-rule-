# MPI Parallel Numerical Integration

This project implements and analyzes an MPI-based parallel trapezoidal integration algorithm, including improved output formatting, dynamic load balancing, command-line parameter handling, and correctness verification across different functions and process configurations. The work demonstrates core concepts in distributed numerical computation, parallel performance measurement, and process coordination with MPI. 

*This project was developed as part of a university course on parallel computing.
